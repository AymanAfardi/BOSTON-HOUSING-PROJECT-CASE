# Boston Housing Statistics Project

## 📖 Overview
This project analyzes the **Boston Housing dataset**, a classic dataset in statistics and machine learning.  
The goal is to explore factors that influence housing prices and build predictive models that capture these relationships.

## 🛠️ Project Structure
- **Boston_statistic_project.ipynb** → Jupyter Notebook containing data exploration, visualization, and model building.
- **data/** → Contains the dataset (if included).
- **README.md** → Project documentation.

## 📊 Key Steps
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Summary statistics  
   - Correlation analysis  
   - Visualization of key features vs. housing prices  

2. **Modeling**  
   - Linear regression to predict housing prices  
   - Model evaluation using metrics such as R² and RMSE  

3. **Results**  
   - Identified strong predictors of house prices (e.g., average rooms per dwelling, socioeconomic status, crime rates)  
   - Regression model explains a significant portion of housing price variance
